📝 Mini Text Editor – C#/.NET Fundamentals Project
📌 Project Overview
Mini Text Editor is a C# console-based application built using .NET, designed to demonstrate core programming fundamentals through a real-world use case.
This project focuses on hands-on learning of C# concepts such as loops, OOP principles, interfaces, exception handling, and file operations.
🎯 Key Objectives
Practice C# fundamentals using a real application
Understand Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Learn file handling operations
Improve exception handling & input validation
Build interview-ready coding skills

⚙️ Features
✔ Create a new text file
✔ Write text to a file
✔ Append text to an existing file
✔ Read file content
✔ Delete file
✔ Menu-driven console interaction

🧠 Concepts Covered
🔁 Programming Fundamentals
while loop for continuous execution
switch-case for menu handling
User input validation using TryParse

🧱 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Interface (ITextEditor)
Implementation class (TextEditorService)
Abstraction using interfaces
Loose coupling between logic and implementation

🧨 Exception Handling
try-catch blocks
Graceful error messages
Runtime safety

📁 File Handling
Create files
Write data
Append data
Read content
Delete files

▶️ How It Works
The program displays a menu-driven interface
User selects an option (Create, Write, Read, Append, Delete)
Input is validated to avoid runtime errors
File operations are performed safely
Errors are handled using exception handling
